Welcome to my presentation!

    I decided to learn the process of setting up a LAMP
    web server.

    LAMP stands for:
    - LINUX
    - APACHE
    - MYSQL
    - PHP

    LAMP is a very common model of web service stack and is suitable
    for building and hosting web sites and web applications."
